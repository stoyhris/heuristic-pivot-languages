# Heuristic Pivot Languages in Machine Translation

The full research work for my undergraduate thesis, supported by all data and code, has been made publicly available through this repo.

* [10 minute presentation](https://ubc.ca.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=50c7a42b-d12d-4322-9e78-afdc0189cc1e) : Provides an intuitive overview of the problem and methods (steering committee called this the "highlight of the night")
* [Heuristic Pivot Languages in Machine Translation](https://github.com/stoyhris/heuristic-pivot-languages/blob/main/Heuristic%20Pivot%20Languages%20in%20Machine%20Translation.pdf) : The full thesis
* [Unsupervised Multilingual Word Embeddings](https://github.com/ccsasuke/umwe) : Used to generate data
* [shortest_path](https://github.com/stoyhris/heuristic-pivot-languages/blob/main/Code%20and%20Data/shortest_path.ipynb) : Shortest path algorithm that determines the best pivot language for any given language pair
* [pvt_improvement](https://github.com/stoyhris/heuristic-pivot-languages/blob/main/Code%20and%20Data/pvt_improvement.ipynb) : Aggregation of results and generating figures -- demonstrates that a carefully chosen pivot language can significantly improve machine translation, but a poorly chosen one can significantly degrade it
